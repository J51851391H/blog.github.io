    <h1>Naperville</h1>
    <h2>Smoke Alarms</h2>
    
<p>In Naperville, the rules for smoke detectors come from three legal sources:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Illinois Smoke Detector Act at <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1640&ChapterID=38&Print=True">425 ILCS 60/1</a></li>
    <li>2018 International Residential Code, <a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IRC2018P7/chapter-3-building-planning#IRC2018P7_Pt03_Ch03_SecR314">Section R314</a></li>
    <li>City of Naperville Municipal Code, Chapter 1 Building Codes, Article B - <a href="https://library.municode.com/il/naperville/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TIT5BURE_CH1BUCO_ARTBRECO_5-1B-2AM">Residential Code</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The state's Smoke Detector Act gives you the basic rules that everyone in Illinois needs to follow. Then, the IRC gets into the nitty-gritty details.  Naperville has adopted the IRC into its Municipal Code but, here's the catch: Naperville didn't just copy-paste the IRC into its code. Instead, it only includes the amendments it decided to make to the IRC.  This means to get the full picture, you'll need to check all three: the state law, the IRC's detailed rules on smoke alarms, and Naperville's tweaks to the IRC.  It's a bit of a jigsaw puzzle, but I've tried to put all the pieces together for you below.</p>

<h3>Which homes are impacted?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Any Illinois home in existence on July 1, 1988. 425 ILCS 60/3(e).</li>
    <li>Also, any Illinois home that was "newly constructed, reconstructed, or substantially remodeled" after December 31, 1987. 425 ILCS 60/3(f).</li>
    <li>For home renovations in Naperville, there's no requirement to upgrade smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors in areas that aren't being renovated. Naperville Municipal Code, 5-1A-3, R314.6 and R316.6. However, all alarms and detectors must be interconnected, meaning if one is triggered, all will sound. This often ends up requiring homeowners to replace all their units. <em>Id</em>. at R314.4.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the Detector Specs?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Must be ionization or photoelectric types. 425 ILCS 60/2</li>
    <li>Must be either (a) hardwired into AC power line or (b) with a self-contained, non-removable long-term battery. 425 ILCS 60/3(e).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where Do They Go?</h3>

<p><strong>placement</strong>. Smoke alarms may be installed either (a) on the ceiling at least 6 inches from the wall or (b) on a wall between 4 to 6 inches from the ceiling. 425 ILCS 60/3(a).</p>

<p><strong>bedrooms</strong>. Each "sleeping area" is required to have its own smoke alarm. IRC 314.3 (2018).</p>

<p><strong>outside bedrooms</strong>. Each "room used for sleeping purposes" must also have a smoke alarm within 15-feet of it. 425 ILCS 60/3(a), IRC 314.3 (20ch18).</p>

<p><strong>each floor</strong>. Each story of the home must have at least 1 smoke alarm. This includes basements and habitable attics. 425 ILCS 60/3(b), IRC 314.3 (2018).</p>

<p><strong>kitchens</strong>. Smoke alarms should not be installed near permanently cooking appliances. For ionization smoke alarms, install them 10 feet away if the alarm has a silencing switch and 20 feet away if the alarm does not have a switch. IRC 314.3.1 (2018) For photoelectric smoke alarms, install them at least 6 feet away from the cooking appliance. <em>Id</em>.</p>

<p><strong>bathrooms</strong>. Smoke alarms should be installed at least 3 feet away from any bathroom that has a shower or bathtub. IRC 314.3 (2018).</p>


<h3>Some Other Points of Interest:</h3>

<p><strong>rentals.</strong> Landlords are required to install the detectors and tenants are required to change the batteries. 425 ILCS 60/3(d)</p>

<p><strong>crime.</strong> There are criminal penalties for violations of the Smoke Detector Act. Willful failure to maintain or install a smoke detector is a Class B misdemeanor. 425 ILCS 60/4(a). And tampering with smoke detector batteries with a malicious intent is a Class A misdemeanor for the first time and Class 4 felony the second time. 425 ILCS 60/4(b).</p>
